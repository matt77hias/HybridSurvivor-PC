## About
A hybrid (i.e. analogue and digital component) game using Unity3D and the Oculus Rift for 2 players.

## Story
You are both treasure hunters looking for the 'black panther' diamond which is located inside a crypt of a garden maze. One player, the *survivor*, is dropped in the garden maze with a parachute. The other player, the *guide*, has access to a map of the garden maze. The map contains some landmarks as well as the location of three keys needed to open the crypt. Both players can communicate over a noisy radio channel to synchronize the survivor's location. 

Unfortunately, it is very dark inside the maze and the survivor has only a limited amount of batteries for his flash light. Luckily, a small number of batteries can be found inside the maze. Time is running out: Will the guide localize the survivor and keep him localized? Will the survivor make detours to find some extra batteries or go straight after the keys? Will the survivor survive? 

Oh one small detail I forgot mentioning: *Do not look into his eyes...*
